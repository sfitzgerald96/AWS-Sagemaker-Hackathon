# AWS Sagemaker Hackathon

## Getting Started
Run this command to get your dev environment setup: `./scripts/dev-env-setup.sh`
The above script will install python if it's not already installed. It will then install all of the needed python packages to get started with developing our AWS Sagemaker model!
# CDK
The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.
